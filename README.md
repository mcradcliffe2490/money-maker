# AI Driven Algorithim Trading based on Reddit Trends

Tells your money where to go based on dumb reddit trends.
Do not use real money unless you are willing to be poor. You have been warned.

# Neccessary Set-up

- After cloning the project, run `npm i` or `npm start` to download dependancies.
- You'll need a Firebase account, an OpenAI account, and an Alpaca algo trading account
- Replace the API_KEYS that you see with your own credentials for each API (never share your Api keys with anyone)

- Install firebase tools by running `npm install -g firebase-tools`
- Run `firebase login` to login to your firebase account
- Run `firebase init` to initalize this project to a firebase project you've created in firebase already or to set up a new one
- Run `firebase deploy` to deploy this project to your firebase account (You'll need a firebase blaze account where you pay for what you use, but this project only uses cents per day)
